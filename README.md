My first Firefox extension! woo!


Wish list for future updates:
- Store a user's mail to things address in their firefox data, so they don't have to re-enter it every time O_o
- Make the extension look prettier
- Handling of special characters (The only thing I know messes the HTML form up is a backslash)
